	abstract = {Until the present moment, most of the medical records are only stored in hospitals. The hospital systems are still in Electronic Medical Records and haven’t developed into Personal Health Records yet to let people manage their own health records. If there is no medical record exchange between hospitals, it may cause a lot of medical resources waste and medical problems. The medical data cannot be exchanged smoothly because of different data standards, data inconsistency, and privacy of patient data. However, Blockchain technology can solve data consistency problems, privacy issues, and centralization problems. So use Blockchain technology to establish a {PHR} system that people can manage by themselves and use {FHIR} of National Medical Information Standard as the data format. People can share their {PHR} with doctors at any time and at any place, and doctors can give a more appropriate and accurate diagnosis. We use Ethereum’s private Blockchain. The system encrypts the {PHR} with an asymmetric key and then uses the Hash function to generate a hash value and write them into the block to ensure data consistency and security. The user can also select the record sharing with others.},
