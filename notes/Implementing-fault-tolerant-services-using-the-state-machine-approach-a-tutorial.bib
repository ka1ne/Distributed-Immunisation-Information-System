	abstract = {The state machine approach is a general method for implementing fault-tolerant services in distributed systems. This paper reviews the approach and describes protocols for two different failure modelsâ€”Byzantine and fail stop. Systems reconfiguration techniques for removing faulty components and integrating repaired components are also discussed.},
