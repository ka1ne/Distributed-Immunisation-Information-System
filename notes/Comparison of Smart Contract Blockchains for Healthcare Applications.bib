	abstract = {Blockchain and smart contracts (i.e., computer code that can be run on blockchain) are increasingly popular for healthcare applications. However, only very few implementations exist because of the complexity of the technologies. Although there are tutorials and reviews to introduce blockchain and smart contracts, a pragmatic comparison of such platforms is needed. In this study, we addressed practical considerations while building a healthcare blockchain and smart contract system, by (1) comparing technical features of platforms, (2) selecting three platforms, (3) constructing blockchain networks, (4) testing the blockchains, and (5) summarizing the experience and time used for implementation by students. We evaluated Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and {MultiChain}, and confirmed that the selection of a proper platform depends on the requirements of the application. The findings of our study can accelerate the process and reduce the risk of adopting blockchain technology in biomedical and healthcare domain.},
