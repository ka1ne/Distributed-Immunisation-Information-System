	abstract = {Emission trading policy provides a new approach using economic incentives to control environmental pollution efficiently. Legal polluters can trade emission permits with each other through a trusted trading system, which lacks security and credibility due to its centralization nowadays. Permissioned blockchain utilize a decentralized way to store private data immutably, providing new approaches to solve those defects of existing centralized systems. In this paper, we propose a Hyperledger-based Emission Trading System ({HyperETS}) on permissioned blockchain. Using Hyperledger Fabric as the implementation platform, {HyperETS} integrates fine-grained access control, distributed ledger and consensus protocol, aiming to provide the credible trading service for polluters. We achieve the business logic by designing particular ledger structures and smart contract in blockchain. {HyperETS} stores all transactions immutably in a chain and makes it easy to share the data between organizations. Finally, several experiments are conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed demonstration system.},
