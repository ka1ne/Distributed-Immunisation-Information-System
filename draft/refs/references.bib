abstract = {Electronic health record ({EHR}) management systems require the adoption of effective technologies when health information is being exchanged. Current management approaches often face risks that may expose medical record storage solutions to common security attack vectors. However, healthcare-oriented blockchain solutions can provide a decentralized, anonymous and secure {EHR} handling approach. This paper presents {PREHEALTH}, a privacy-preserving {EHR} management solution that uses distributed ledger technology and an Identity Mixer (Idemix). The paper describes a proof-of-concept implementation that uses the Hyperledger Fabric\&rsquo;s permissioned blockchain framework. The proposed solution is able to store patient records effectively whilst providing anonymity and unlinkability. Experimental performance evaluation results demonstrate the scheme\&rsquo;s efficiency and feasibility for real-world scale deployment.},

	abstract = {This paper explores how the Internet of Things and blockchain technology can benefit shared economy applications. The focus of this research is understanding how blockchain can be exploited to create decentralised, shared economy applications that allow people to monetise, securely, their things to create more wealth. Shared economy applications such as Airbnb and Uber are well-known applications, but there are many other opportunities to share in the digital economy. With the recent interest in the Internet of Things and blockchain, the opportunity exists to create a myriad of sharing applications, e.g. peer-to-peer automatic payment mechanisms, foreign exchange platforms, digital rights management and cultural heritage to name but a few. While many types of shared economy scenarios are proliferating, few of them, so far, leverage the Internet of Things and blockchain as technologies to build distributed applications. This paper discusses how we might make use of the Internet of Things and blockchains to create secure shared economy distributed applications. Presented are examples of such distributed applications in the context of an Internet of Things architecture using blockchain technology.},

	abstract = {Modern healthcare systems are characterized as being highly complex and costly. However, this can be reduced through improved health record management, utilization of insurance agencies, and blockchain technology. Blockchain was first introduced to provide distributed records of money-related exchanges that were not dependent on centralized authorities or financial institutions. Breakthroughs in blockchain technology have led to improved transactions involving medical records, insurance billing, and smart contracts, enabling permanent access to and security of data, as well as providing a distributed database of transactions. One significant advantage of using blockchain technology in the healthcare industry is that it can reform the interoperability of healthcare databases, providing increased access to patient medical records, device tracking, prescription databases, and hospital assets, including the complete life cycle of a device within the blockchain infrastructure. Access to patients’ medical histories is essential to correctly prescribe medication, with blockchain being able to dramatically enhance the healthcare services framework. In this paper, several solutions for improving current limitations in healthcare systems using blockchain technology are explored, including frameworks and tools to measure the performance of such systems, e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Composer, Docker Container, Hyperledger Caliper, and the Wireshark capture engine. Further, this paper proposes an Access Control Policy Algorithm for improving data accessibility between healthcare providers, assisting in the simulation of environments to implement the Hyperledger-based eletronic healthcare record ({EHR}) sharing system that uses the concept of a chaincode. Performance metrics in blockchain networks, such as latency, throughput, Round Trip Time ({RTT}). have also been optimized for achieving enhanced results. Compared to traditional {EHR} systems, which use client-server architecture, the proposed system uses blockchain for improving efficiency and security.},

	abstract = {Electronic government (e-government) uses information and communication technologies to deliver public services to individuals and organisations effectively, efficiently and transparently. E-government is one of the most complex systems which needs to be distributed, secured and privacy-preserved, and the failure of these can be very costly both economically and socially. Most of the existing e-government systems such as websites and electronic identity management systems ({eIDs}) are centralized at duplicated servers and databases.A centralized management and validation system may suffer from a single point of failure and make the system a target to cyber attacks such as malware, denial of service attacks ({DoS}), and distributed denial of service attacks ({DDoS}). The blockchain technology enables the implementation of highly secure and privacy-preserving decentralized systems where transactions are not under the control of any third party organizations. Using the blockchain technology, exiting data and new data are stored in a sealed compartment of blocks (i.e., ledger) distributed across the network in a verifiable and immutable way. Information security and privacy are enhanced by the blockchain technology in which data are encrypted and distributed across the entire network. This paper proposes a framework of a decentralized e-government peer-to-peer (p2p) system using the blockchain technology, which can ensure both information security and privacy while simultaneously increasing the trust of the public sectors. In addition, a prototype of the proposed system is presented, with the support of a theoretical and qualitative analysis of the security and privacy implications of such system.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is emerging as a new computing paradigm in the healthcare sector besides other business domains. Large numbers of health organizations have started shifting the electronic health information to the cloud environment. Introducing the cloud services in the health sector not only facilitates the exchange of electronic medical records among the hospitals and clinics, but also enables the cloud to act as a medical record storage center. Moreover, shifting to the cloud environment relieves the healthcare organizations of the tedious tasks of infrastructure management and also minimizes development and maintenance costs. Nonetheless, storing the patient health data in the third-party servers also entails serious threats to data privacy. Because of probable disclosure of medical records stored and exchanged in the cloud, the patients' privacy concerns should essentially be considered when designing the security and privacy mechanisms. Various approaches have been used to preserve the privacy of the health information in the cloud environment. This survey aims to encompass the state-of-the-art privacy-preserving approaches employed in the e-Health clouds. Moreover, the privacy-preserving approaches are classified into cryptographic and noncryptographic approaches and taxonomy of the approaches is also presented. Furthermore, the strengths and weaknesses of the presented approaches are reported and some open issues are highlighted.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is an emerging technology for decentralised and transactional data sharing across a large network of untrusted participants. It enables new forms of distributed software architectures, where agreement on shared states can be established without trusting a central integration point. A major difficulty for architects designing applications based on blockchain is that the technology has many configurations and variants. Since blockchains are at an early stage, there is little product data or reliable technology evaluation available to compare different blockchains. In this paper, we propose how to classify and compare blockchains and blockchain-based systems to assist with the design and assessment of their impact on software architectures. Our taxonomy captures major architectural characteristics of blockchains and the impact of their principal design decisions. This taxonomy is intended to help with important architectural considerations about the performance and quality attributes of blockchain-based systems.},

Central to this model is the service-dominant “building-block”-type provision of care services to patients, paired with the collaboration of healthcare providers through a common infrastructure. This combination enables the forming of a decentralized, holistic care cycle. Sharing of patient medical informationis pivotal towards reaching this goal; however, preserving medical record integrity and privacy, while at the same time allowing provider interoperability are often conflicting requirements. Blockchains and Smart Contracts can provide the underlying technology to support the decentralized care cycle by addressing patient privacy and medical record integrity, while simultaneously offering efficient interoperability between providers. To demonstrate how this could be achieved, a conceptual medical record access and sharing mechanism is presented which is suitable for a system operating within a regulated healthcare jurisdiction.},

	shorttitle = {Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain},
	abstract = {Hyperledger Fabric, created and supported by the Linux Foundation and {IBM}, is one of the most popular open-source blockchain permissioned platforms that has been already used in many industrial scenarios. One of the main characteristics of this platform is that it provides a smart contract system that relies on general-purpose languages instead of an ad hoc one. In fact, a chaincode in the Fabric platform (the equivalent of the Ethereum smart contract) is a software program which encapsulates the business logic for the creation and modification of logical assets in the ledger that can be written in different general-purpose programming languages (currently Java, Go, and Node.js). This paper analyses the transaction performance of the Fabric platform by identifying at a fine-grained degree level the factors that most contribute to the overall overhead. In particular, we focus on how the transaction latency is affected by the programming language adopted for implementing the chaincode and by varying the number of participating endorser peers. Finally, the paper shows a thorough test assessment aimed at evaluating the impact of the different chaincode implementation on performance overhead. As it emerges from our experimental results, Go is the most performing programming language.},

	abstract = {As countries grow eager to reignite their economies and people increasingly yearn for mobility and normalcy in life, pressure is mounting for some form of {COVID}-19 health status certificate that would support these desires. There has already been an explosion of {COVID}-19 passport initiatives for domestic use and international travel. But scientific, legal, and ethical concerns abound with such documentation. Given the high stakes, what is the path forward?

From doctors' examinations to ship inspections, clean bills of health have secured passage through centuries of human plagues. Today's best-known health passport is the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, created by the World Health Organization ({WHO}). {WHO}'s Yellow Card has certified vaccinations for cholera, plague, and typhoid, among other infections. There is certainly precedent for a {COVID}-19 vaccination passport certifying that the holder can travel, study, play, and work without compromising personal or public health. Among newly proposed {COVID}-19 passport schemes are the {WHO}'s Smart Vaccination Certificate, Israel's “green passport,” the European Union's proposed Digital Green Pass, and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention's “My {COVID} Pass.”

Given the momentum, what are the main principles that {COVID}-19 passports should follow to ensure their appropriate use?

A {COVID}-19 passport should be scientifically valid. Passport holders must be protected from illness so that they can carry out the activities for which the passport has been issued and to avoid burdening health services. A passport would ideally certify that holders are not, and cannot become, a source of infection for others. Vaccines have high efficacy in preventing symptomatic {COVID}-19, and there is growing evidence that they can prevent transmission too. No vaccine is perfect, and it remains to be determined whether vaccines meet minimum requirements for preventing infection and illness. The duration of protection conferred by vaccines should be tied to passport expiry dates, perhaps with options to revoke passports if new coronavirus variants compromise efficacy. These passports should also be judged for their comparative advantage. They may be preferable to viral {RNA} and antigen tests, which aim to certify that individuals are temporarily free of infection, and to antibody tests, which do not guarantee immunity to infection or disease.

The vaccination certificate should be portable, affordable, and linked safely and securely to the identity of the holder. Ideally, it will be internationally standardized with verifiable credentials and based on interoperable technologies. Forgery and personal data security are dominant concerns, but such problems are routinely solved for financial and other sensitive transactions.

Many issues surround the fair use of vaccination passports. The widely held view is that documents must avoid discrimination and inequity. Ideally, a passport would be exclusive only with respect to its primary purpose, which is to protect the health of individuals and others with whom they come into contact. But such exclusions inevitably raise barriers elsewhere. Some, such as restrictions on nonessential leisure activities, should be relatively easy to manage. The greatest risk is that people for whom vaccination is unacceptable, untested, inaccessible, or impossible are denied access to essential goods and services. This could happen where there is vaccine hesitancy or refusal among certain ethnic minorities; where there are no data on vaccine efficacy for people at risk, such as children and pregnant women; where migrants are undocumented and unreachable; where passports are exclusively digital, barring people without smartphones; and where people are not yet eligible for vaccination. These examples signal the need for alternatives and exemptions.

Some decisions about how to use passports will be made by public debate and consent, drawing on social and ethical norms. Others will be determined by domestic and international law. Some employers have already announced “no jab, no job” policies. In such cases, the freedom of choice for individual employees, set against a firm's duty and preference for the care of all staff, might be tested in court.

{COVID}-19 is a new human disease. The challenges presented by vaccination passports are also new in detail, but mostly familiar in kind. Adding to current, imperfect certification procedures by diagnostic tests, vaccination passports are likely to be widely adopted during the pandemic and its probable sequel, endemic and episodic disease. The choice about how passports are used should be guided by exemplary science, appropriate technologies, and fair use for all.},

	abstract = {With the exponential rise in the number of devices, the Internet of Things ({IoT}) is geared toward edge-centric computing to offer high bandwidth, low latency, and improved connectivity. In contrast, legacy cloud-centric platforms offer deteriorated bandwidth and connectivity that affect the quality of service. Edge-centric Internet of Things-based technologies, such as fog and mist computing, offer distributed and decentralized solutions to resolve the drawbacks of cloud-centric models. However, to foster distributed edge-centric models, a decentralized consensus system is necessary to incentivize all participants to share their edge resources. This paper is motivated by the shortage of comprehensive reviews on decentralized consensus systems for edge-centric Internet of Things that elucidates myriad of consensus facets, such as data structure, scalable consensus ledgers, and transaction models. Decentralized consensus systems adopt either blockchain or blockchainless directed acyclic graph technologies, which serve as immutable public ledgers for transactions. This paper scrutinizes the pros and cons of state-of-the-art decentralized consensus systems. With an extensive literature review and categorization based on existing decentralized consensus systems, we propose a thematic taxonomy. The pivotal features and characteristics associated with existing decentralized consensus systems are analyzed via a comprehensive qualitative investigation. The commonalities and variances among these systems are analyzed using key criteria derived from the presented literature. Finally, several open research issues on decentralized consensus for edge-centric {IoT} are presented, which should be highlighted regarding centralization risk and deficiencies in blockchain/blockchainless solutions.},

In this paper, we propose a Hyperledger-based Emission Trading System ({HyperETS}) on permissioned blockchain. Using Hyperledger Fabric as the implementation platform, {HyperETS} integrates fine-grained access control, distributed ledger and consensus protocol, aiming to provide the credible trading service for polluters. We achieve the business logic by designing particular ledger structures and smart contract in blockchain. {HyperETS} stores all transactions immutably in a chain and makes it easy to share the data between organizations. Finally, several experiments are conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed demonstration system.},

Furthermore, cryptocurrencies' historical background as a driver of fully decentralized distributed ledgers is outlined from their origins in the 1990s until the blockchain concept's introduction in 2009. {DLT}'s technical principles are introduced to provide a sound understanding. Subsequently, the functioning of distributed ledger technology is illustrated by means of the Bitcoin blockchain example, which was the first fully decentralized cryptocurrency to not require a trusted authority (i.e., banks). Thereafter, smart contracts and the idea of decentralized applications are explained. Selected use cases for distributed ledger technology's application are subsequently discussed.

	abstract = {Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org). Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing blockchain platforms that require "smart-contracts" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks. This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.},

This design pattern is partition-independent, because it is expressed in terms of an interactive application running in a single address space. Applying the Model/View/Controller design pattern to web-applications is therefore complicated by the fact that current technologies encourage developers to partition the application as early as in the design phase. Subsequent changes to that partitioning require considerable changes to the application's implementation-despite the fact that the application logic has not changed. This paper introduces the concept of Flexible Web-Application Partitioning, a programming model and implementation infrastructure, that allows developers to apply the Model/View/Controller design pattern in a partition-independent manner Applications are developed and tested in a single address-space; they can then be deployed to various client/server architectures without changing the application's source code. In addition, partitioning decisions can be changed without modifying the application.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, a countless number of permissioned blockchain solutions have been proposed, with each one to claim that it revolutionizes the way of the transaction processing along with the security and privacy preserving mechanisms that it provides. Hyperledger Fabric is one of the most popular permissioned blockchain architectures that has made a significant impact on the market. However, there are only few papers of finding architectural risks regarding the security and the privacy preserving mechanisms of Hyperledger Fabric. This paper separates the attack surface of the blockchain platform into four components, namely, consensus, chaincode, network and privacy preserving mechanisms, in all of which an attacker (from inside or outside the network) can exploit the platform's design and gain access to or misuse the network. In addition, we highlight the appropriate counter-measures that can be taken in each component to address the corresponding risks and provide a significantly secure and enhanced privacy preserving Fabric network. We hope that by bringing this paper into light, we can aid developers to avoid security flaws and implementations that can be exploited by attackers but also to motivate further research to harden the platform's security and the client's privacy.},

The hospital systems are still in Electronic Medical Records and haven’t developed into Personal Health Records yet to let people manage their own health records. If there is no medical record exchange between hospitals, it may cause a lot of medical resources waste and medical problems. The medical data cannot be exchanged smoothly because of different data standards, data inconsistency, and privacy of patient data. However, Blockchain technology can solve data consistency problems, privacy issues, and centralization problems. So use Blockchain technology to establish a {PHR} system that people can manage by themselves and use {FHIR} of National Medical Information Standard as the data format. People can share their {PHR} with doctors at any time and at any place, and doctors can give a more appropriate and accurate diagnosis. We use Ethereum’s private Blockchain. The system encrypts the {PHR} with an asymmetric key and then uses the Hash function to generate a hash value and write them into the block to ensure data consistency and security. The user can also select the record sharing with others.},

This paper surveys the research outputs of both academia and industry. First, it introduces the representative architectures of {BaaS} systems, and then summarizes the research contributions of {BaaS} from technologies for service provision, roles, container and virtualization, interfaces, customization and evaluation. The typical applications of {BaaS} in both academic and practical domains are also introduced. At present, the research on blockchain is abundant, but research on {BaaS} is still in its infancy.

Similarly, the healthcare sector stands to benefit immensely from the blockchain technology due to security, privacy, confidentiality and decentralization. Nevertheless, the Electronic Health Record ({EHR}) systems face problems regarding data security, integrity and management. In this paper, we discuss how the blockchain technology can be used to transform the {EHR} systems and could be a solution of these issues. We present a framework that could be used for the implementation of blockchain technology in healthcare sector for {EHR}. The aim of our proposed framework is firstly to implement blockchain technology for {EHR} and secondly to provide secure storage of electronic records by defining granular access rules for the users of the proposed framework. Moreover, this framework also discusses the scalability problem faced by the blockchain technology in general via use of off-chain storage of the records. This framework provides the {EHR} system with the benefits of having a scalable, secure and integral blockchain-based solution.},

This paper discusses the kind of (non-)determinism of the methods of the Java library and how a deterministic fragment of that library can be specified. It shows that some relevant parts are deterministic only under specific conditions on run-time values. It concludes with the description of an instrumentation, for the Takamaka blockchain, that enforces such conditions, statically or dynamically, reporting experiments with its implementation.},

The payoff for a distributed configuration in terms of survivability in the cases of enemy attack directed against nodes, links or combinations of nodes and links is demonstrated. A comparison is made between diversity of assignment and perfect switching in distributed networks, and the feasibility of using low-cost unreliable communication links, even links so unreliable as to be unusable in present type networks, to form highly reliable networks is discussed. The requirements for a future all-digital data distributed network which provides common user service for a wide range of users having different requirements is considered. The use of a standard format message block permits building relatively simple switching mechanisms using an adaptive store-and-forward routing policy to handle all forms of digital data including digital voice. This network rapidly responds to changes in the network status. Recent history of measured network traffic is used to modify path selection. Simulation results are shown to indicate that highly efficient routing can be performed by local control without the necessity for any central, and therefore vulnerable, control point.},

In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos.

	abstract = {The problem addressed here concerns a set of isolated processors, some unknown subset of which may be faulty, that communicate only by means of two-party messages. Each nonfaulty processor has a private value of information that must be communicated to each other nonfaulty processor. Nonfaulty processors always communicate honestly, whereas faulty processors may lie. The problem is to devise an algorithm in which processors communicate their own values and relay values received from others that allows each nonfaulty processor to infer a value for each other processor. The value inferred for a nonfaulty processor must be that processor's private value, and the value inferred for a faulty one must be consistent with the corresponding value inferred by each other nonfaulty processor. It is shown that the problem is solvable for, and only for, n ≥ 3m + 1, where m is the number of faulty processors and n is the total number. It is also shown that if faulty processors can refuse to pass on information but cannot falsely relay information, the problem is solvable for arbitrary n ≥ m ≥ 0. This weaker assumption can be approximated in practice using cryptographic methods.},

	abstract = {One of well-known Hyperledger platform named Hyperledger Fabric, which was firstdeveloped by {IBM} and Digital Asset, is a blockchain framework with execute-ordervalidate architecture. With this architecture, transactions on Hyperledger Fabric becomedeterministic. One of the nodes that plays an important role in the process is orderingservice node. It plays a role in maintaining channel configuration and create a block oftransaction. In its implementation, Hyperledger Fabric consists of three ordering servicenode types, namely Solo, Kafka, and Raft. Solo does not have a consensus algorithm andis only used during the development of blockchain networks while Kafka and Raft have(crash fault tolerant). This paper simulates Blockchain Network with Kafka and Raft asimplementation of the ordering service node. From the research obtained, it is known {thatRaft} is more superior than Kafka in terms of success rate and throughput rate whenconducting invoke transactions due to its simpler framework (Raft has the Raft consenterwhich was created directly from ordering service nodes) than Kafka (which {requiresKafka} brokers and Zookeeper Ensembled). However, in the process of querying thetransaction, Kafka is superior to Raft since the throughput rate is bigger than Raft.},

	doi = {10.1109/DSN.2018.00018},
	abstract = {Hyperledger Fabric is a flexible operating system for permissioned blockchains designed for business applications beyond the basic digital coin addressed by Bitcoin and other existing networks. A key property of this system is its extensibility, and in particular the support for multiple ordering services for building the blockchain. However, version 1 was launched in 2017 without an implementation of a Byzantine fault-tolerant ({BFT}) ordering service. To overcome this limitation, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a {BFT} ordering service for this system on top of the {BFT}-{SMART} state machine replication/consensus library, with optimizations for wide-area deployment. Our results show that our ordering service can process up to ten thousand transactions per second and write a transaction irrevocably in the blockchain in half a second, even with peers spread across different continents.},
