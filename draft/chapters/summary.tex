This project proposes, designs and implements a Distributed-Immunisation-Information-System (DIIS).
Backed by a blockchain network, built with Hyperledger Fabric, the system includes a web application that facilitates confidential storage of immunisation information. 
The immunisation records are stored in the ledger of the blockchain network, via invocation of smart contracts. In Hyperledger Fabric smart contracts are called chaincode.
Chaincode developed for the project enables submission and validation of immunisation records, which are off limits to untrusted participants. 
The aim of the system is to provide an example of how current electronic health records and systems can be improved upon with the aid of distributed ledger technologies.
